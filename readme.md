# OpenCV Motion Detection Practice

This project serves as a practical exercise for mastering OpenCV's computer vision concepts through motion detection using contouring techniques in Python. By following this project, you will learn how to leverage the OpenCV library to detect motion in a video stream and apply contouring methods to highlight and analyze the detected motion areas.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Real-Time Motion Detection:** Implement a real-time motion detection system that processes video frames from a camera feed.

- **Background Subtraction:** Utilize OpenCV's background subtraction techniques to isolate moving objects from the background.

- **Contour Analysis:** Apply contouring to identify and analyze distinct regions of motion within the video stream.

- **Alarm Triggering:** Respond to detected motion by triggering an alarm sound.

- **Interactive Visualization:** Display video frames with highlighted motion areas using bounding rectangles.

4. To exit the script, press the 'q' key.

## Understanding the Concepts

This project deepens your understanding of the following OpenCV concepts:

- **Background Subtraction:** Learn how to subtract the background from a video frame to highlight moving objects.

- **Contour Analysis:** Master the technique of contouring to identify and analyze regions of interest.

- **Image Preprocessing:** Apply image preprocessing techniques such as Gaussian blur and morphological operations to enhance motion detection accuracy.

- **Threading:** Utilize threading to play the alarm sound asynchronously while maintaining motion detection.

## Possible Extensions

Explore further enhancements to this project:

- Implement more advanced background subtraction methods like the KNN algorithm.
